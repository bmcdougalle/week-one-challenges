Write out a collection of conditionals that evaluates a new variable for how many hours of sleep the user gets.
You can just initialize this variable for now

    If the hours slept is greater or equal to 10, write to the console "Wow that's a lot of sleep!"
    (else if)
    If the hours is greater than 8 but less than 10, write to the console "You should be pretty rested"
    (else if)
    If the hours is greater than 4 but less than 8, output "Bummer"
    (else)
    For any other condition output "Oh man, get some sleep!"


    Write out a switch case that evaluates a variable that holds the value for how the user's day has been.

    Have a case for: "Great", "Good", "Okay", "Bad", ":(" and output a response to the Console for each.
